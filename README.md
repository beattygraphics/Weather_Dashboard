## Review / Issues
Wow... I really struggeled with this project.  I had to ask for some help from a friend and I still couldn not get it finished.  Shout out to "John Youngman"  he is a great friend and was a great teacher in trying to get what I needed out fo the 2 separate APIS i had to use for this. I will need to resumbit once I can get the proper info to append to the page.
